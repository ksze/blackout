# TODO
- setup and teardown scripts
- testing
- maybe a better source of blocklist (ipdeny.com doesn't even support HTTPS)
- other safety improvements
- Configuration
    - Choosing particular (inbound and outbound) ports to block, instead of blocking all ports
    - Frequency of updating the firewall rules.
    - REJECT vs DROP
